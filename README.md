# switchTable
A simple table display for admin users

### Functions
> * The table will display a subset of the table data, which consist of the following columns:
- [x] First name
- [x] Last name
- [x] Email
- [x] Role
- [x] Department
> * The table view should allow you to sort by any of the above columns. A search box allows you to search users by keyword.
** BUG: The searching keyword can not be shorter than 3 charactors.
> *  The table should provide an action button/link â€“ When clicked, a popup lightbox will be displayed with a detailed view for a particular user. The detailed view should include all of the information from the underlying table, including their age.
** Feature Changed: Rather than click on a apparent button/link, use highlighted row click instead.
> * The table should support pagination for up to 10 people per page.
** Feature Added: Pagination size change.
